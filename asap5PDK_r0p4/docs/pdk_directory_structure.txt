    |   |   |                  				  designing with the asap5 PDK. It also contains asap5 transistors supplied for use
    |   |   |                  				  during transistor-level design. Both N-type and P-type MOSFETs come in four
    |   |   |                  				  Vt flavors, viz. regular Vt (RVT), low Vt (LVT), super-low Vt (SLVT), and

    |   |   |                  				  view 'symbol' must be used for the purpose of device instantiation. Defined
    |   |   |                  				  as 'asap5_TechLib' in the cds.lib.

    |   |               				 This particular file is copied to the user's local run
    |   |               				 directory upon sourcing the setup script. It defines the
    |   |               				 asap5 technology as well as standard cell library, and a

    |   |               				 suite—containing logic gate symbols. It also includes another
    |   |               				 cds.lib bundled with Cadence design suite, which defines the
